        <h1>Reflection on "The Playlist"</h1>
        <p>The first episode of the series talks about Daniel Ek, the creator of Spotify. He believes that the music industry is about to undergo a digital revolution,
            <br>and he wants to lead that transformation. He applied to Google but was declined because he didn't have a university degree. Daniel had an idea to create
            <br>a streaming service for free music, but people in the industry were not used to the idea. They believed that he needed to get a radio license and rights
            <br>from record labels to play music. Despite this, Daniel continued pitching his idea and approached Per Sundin, the CEO of the Sony Sweden music branch.
            <br>However, Per was not interested in the idea and warned him against it. Daniel realized that the youth of today could be the key to popularizing his idea.
            <br>So, he went to the local school to spread the word about Spotify. My thoughts on Daniel are that he is an amazing coder; he even hacked Google and
            <br>made an online marketing website where companies get ten percent of the revenue for every click on their page. He is also a person who has a very
            <br>innovative mindset and an entrepreneurial spirit, and because of that, he was able to make a significant impact on the music industry, making Spotify an
            <br>app used by millions of users all over the world. I think that the storyline of the series was really interesting, and as the show went on, it really showed
            <br>how revolutionary it was. The storyline really showed how many struggles Daniel Ek faced just to make Spotify; it showed that even with the countless
            <br>rejections of his idea for a streaming service, he still pursued it and never gave up on it. Overall, The Playlist is a solid and well-written series, with good
            <br>acting and a solid premise.</p>
